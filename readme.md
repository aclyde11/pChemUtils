## Parallel Streaming Chemical Utils

Just a collection of scripts that I use a lot such as cleaning smile files, creating fingerprints, and running similarity.

All of these files will mostly expect plain text input with single items per lines.


file naming protocols for myself
- .txt = smile only
- .smi = smile name
- .bits.fp  = binary string finger print one per line. size in .bits
- .smv = smile value
- .csv = one column needs to be named smiles
